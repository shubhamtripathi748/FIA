Establish the foundational platform using AWS Landing Zone Accelerator, creating a secure and scalable infrastructure that will support both immediate and future requirements.

The foundation phase establishes the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator implementation, creating a secure and scalable multi-account structure. This phase is crucial for ensuring the platform can support both immediate R1 requirements and future expansion.
Landing Zone Implementation
The AWS environment will be structured with distinct accounts for:
•	Management Account
•	Organizations management
•	Billing consolidation
•	Policy administration
•	Cross-account logging
Security Account
•	Centralized security services
•	GuardDuty deployment
•	Security Hub management
•	CloudTrail aggregation
•	Compliance monitoring
Shared Services Account
•	CI/CD pipelines
•	Artifact repositories
•	Common components
•	Monitoring solutions
Production Account
•	ASN isolation frameworks
•	Application services
•	Data storage
•	API services
Security Framework Implementation
The security framework establishes fundamental controls that will protect all current and future ASN implementations:
Data Protection
•	Encryption at rest using AWS KMS with ASN-specific keys
•	Encryption in transit using TLS 1.3
•	Data lifecycle management
•	Backup and recovery procedures
Access Control
•	Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies
•	Role-based access control (RBAC)
•	Resource tagging strategy
•	Session management
Monitoring and Audit
•	Centralized logging
•	Real-time alerting
•	Compliance reporting
•	Activity tracking


Phase 0: Out of Scope
•	Implementation of business functionality
•	Application development
•	Data migration
•	Integration with external systems
•	User interface development
•	Mobile application development
•	Training and documentation
•	Production environment setup
Implementation Plan
Phase 0: Foundation (4 weeks)
Week 1-4:
•	AWS account structure setup
•	Network architecture deployment
•	Core security controls implementation
•	CI/CD pipeline configuration
•	Monitoring and logging setup
•	Development environment provisioning


Project Deliverables
