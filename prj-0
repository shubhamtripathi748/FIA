1. AWS Landing Zone Implementation

Objective:

To establish a well-architected, multi-account AWS environment that ensures governance, security, and compliance.

Key Components:

AWS Organizations: Manages multiple AWS accounts under a single structure.

AWS Control Tower: Automates the setup of a secure, compliant multi-account environment.

Account Structure:

Management Account: Handles billing and governance.

Security Account: Manages logging, monitoring, and security operations.

Networking Account: Manages VPCs, Direct Connect, and networking services.

Workload Accounts: Separate accounts for Dev, Test, and Prod workloads.

Networking Setup:

AWS VPCs with Private/Public Subnets.

Transit Gateway for inter-account connectivity.

AWS Direct Connect for hybrid networking (if applicable).

Logging and Monitoring:

AWS CloudTrail enabled across all accounts for auditing.

AWS Config for resource compliance monitoring.

AWS Security Hub for security insights.

Assumptions:

AWS Control Tower is used for multi-account setup.

Compliance baselines follow AWS Well-Architected Framework.

IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) is enabled for user authentication.

2. Multi-Account Security Framework

Objective:

To enforce security policies, access control, and monitoring across multiple AWS accounts.

Key Security Controls:

Centralized Security Management:

AWS Security Hub for security posture assessment.

AWS GuardDuty for anomaly detection.

AWS Config for resource compliance validation.

Identity and Access Management (IAM):

Role-based access control (RBAC) using IAM roles.

IAM permission boundaries to restrict access.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all privileged users.

Encryption and Data Protection:

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encrypting data in S3, RDS, and DynamoDB.

TLS encryption enforced for network traffic.

Network Security:

AWS WAF & Shield for protection against web attacks.

VPC Flow Logs for traffic monitoring.

Security Groups and Network ACLs for granular access control.

Automated Security Remediation:

AWS Config Rules and Lambda for auto-remediation.

Incident response playbooks integrated with AWS Security Hub.

Assumptions:

Security monitoring is centralized using AWS Security Hub.

SCPs enforce security policies across accounts.

IAM users are not used; only IAM roles with permissions.

3. CI/CD Pipeline Setup

Objective:

To automate application and infrastructure deployment with security and compliance checks.

CI/CD Components:

AWS CodePipeline: Manages the workflow of CI/CD.

AWS CodeBuild: Builds and tests code.

AWS CodeDeploy: Automates deployment to AWS services.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure automation.

Terraform (if applicable) for additional automation.

Security & Compliance Integration:

Static code analysis using SonarQube, Snyk, and AWS CodeGuru.

AWS Config and CloudFormation Guard for policy compliance.

Deployment Strategies:

Blue/Green Deployments for zero-downtime updates.

Canary Deployments for controlled rollouts.

Automated rollback mechanisms in case of failure.

Version Control:

GitHub, AWS CodeCommit, or Bitbucket for managing source code.

Assumptions:

AWS CodePipeline is the primary CI/CD orchestrator.

All deployments are infrastructure as code (IaC) based.

Security scanning is embedded in CI/CD workflows.
















Establish the foundational platform using AWS Landing Zone Accelerator, creating a secure and scalable infrastructure that will support both immediate and future requirements.

The foundation phase establishes the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator implementation, creating a secure and scalable multi-account structure. This phase is crucial for ensuring the platform can support both immediate R1 requirements and future expansion.
Landing Zone Implementation
The AWS environment will be structured with distinct accounts for:
•	Management Account
•	Organizations management
•	Billing consolidation
•	Policy administration
•	Cross-account logging
Security Account
•	Centralized security services
•	GuardDuty deployment
•	Security Hub management
•	CloudTrail aggregation
•	Compliance monitoring
Shared Services Account
•	CI/CD pipelines
•	Artifact repositories
•	Common components
•	Monitoring solutions
Production Account
•	ASN isolation frameworks
•	Application services
•	Data storage
•	API services
Security Framework Implementation
The security framework establishes fundamental controls that will protect all current and future ASN implementations:
Data Protection
•	Encryption at rest using AWS KMS with ASN-specific keys
•	Encryption in transit using TLS 1.3
•	Data lifecycle management
•	Backup and recovery procedures
Access Control
•	Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies
•	Role-based access control (RBAC)
•	Resource tagging strategy
•	Session management
Monitoring and Audit
•	Centralized logging
•	Real-time alerting
•	Compliance reporting
•	Activity tracking


Phase 0: Out of Scope
•	Implementation of business functionality
•	Application development
•	Data migration
•	Integration with external systems
•	User interface development
•	Mobile application development
•	Training and documentation
•	Production environment setup
Implementation Plan
Phase 0: Foundation (4 weeks)
Week 1-4:
•	AWS account structure setup
•	Network architecture deployment
•	Core security controls implementation
•	CI/CD pipeline configuration
•	Monitoring and logging setup
•	Development environment provisioning


Project Deliverables
Phase 0: Foundation
1.	AWS Landing Zone Implementation
2.	Multi-Account Security Framework
